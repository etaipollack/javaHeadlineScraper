## Headline Scraper

HOW TO USE:
When the program is run, it prompts the user to what news website they would like to receive headlines from. After the user types in an option and waits a short time, a link is created to an HTML document that lists the headlines.

This was built using BeautifulSoup, which allowed the program to receive the source HTML document, which was then filtered for the proper headlines and their respective links. 

Must have bs4 and requests module
